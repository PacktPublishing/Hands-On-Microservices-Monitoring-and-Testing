Microservices are the latest "right" way of developing web applications. Microservices architecture has been gaining momentum over the past few years, but once you've started down the microservices path, you need to test and optimize the services. This book focuses on exploring various testing, monitoring, and optimization techniques
for microservices.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the architecture of microservices and how to build services
* Establish how external APIs help to accelerate the development process
* Understand testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and UI/functional testing
