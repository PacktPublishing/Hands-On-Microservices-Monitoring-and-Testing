This book focuses on exploring various testing, monitoring, and optimization techniques
for microservices.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the architecture of microservices and how to build services
* Establish how external APIs help to accelerate the development process
* Understand testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and UI/functional testing
